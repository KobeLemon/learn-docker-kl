# Preparing to Thrive in a Container World

This file contains notes for the "**Preparing to Thrive in a Container World**" section of the [Docker and Kubernetes: The Big Picture](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/docker-kubernetes-big-picture/table-of-contents) PluralSight Class by Nigel Poulton.

## Summary

- ### Individual

  - The two things you need to survive and thrive are **knowledge** and **experience**.

  - There are many free tools that you can use to start learning Docker and Kubernetes.

  - You can run containers on your own cloud, or on premade clouds like AWS, Azure, Google, etc.

  - Learn by doing.

- ### Organization

  - Accept that containers are coming.

  - Check if your team is already using containers.

  - Start making containers official.

  - Build a small specialist team to learn & deploy any new tools, then seed it through the rest of the business.

  - Make sure all teams are talking to each other.

  - Think about budget.

  - Start small, think big!

## ----------------------- Deeper Explanation -----------------------

## Individual Preparedness

- The two things you need to survive and thrive are **knowledge** and **experience**.

- Some people are hand on like developers, system administrators, & devops, while others are hands off like architects.

- Docker Desktop is free from Docker Inc. whcch runs on Windows and Mac & it is a great tool to build Docker/Kubernetes containers.

- In the Docker and Kubernetes space, you can create and run containers on your laptop, a cloud, or an on-premises server.

- You can run your own cloud (though clouds can be expensive), or you could use **EKS from Amazon Web Services (AWS), or AKS from Azure, or GKE from Google, or others.**

- There are also free online playgrounds such as **Play with Docker** & **Play With Kubernetes**.

- Learning from videos & tutorials is great, but the best learning is hands on & learning by doing.

## Organization Preparedness

- Change can be hard to accept, especially when you are used to doing things a certain way, but the best way to start learning something new is to accept that you need to learn/use it.

- Containers are the future & one of the best solutions so it will be nigh impossible to avoid containers in the future.

- Story time: When cloud computing was first starting out, there was a mega-corporation that thought containers were not useful and they didn't need it so they invested nothing into containers. Other companies like Amazon & Google capitalized on containers & they soared beyond this mega-corp. Now this mega-corp is stuck playing catch up.

- Moral of the story: take a step back & think about where containers might be of at least a little bit of use to your organization.

- You can also ask others in your team if you are already using containers and that will let you know where to start.

- Start making containers an official tool in your organization, make sure they are being used effectively and efficiently.

- Instead of making everyone learn a new tool at once & slow down production, you can have a small team who delves deep and starts to implement it, then they teach it to the rest of the team.

- You will need to have people who can build up strong infrastructure to support the new tools.

- You will need to think about what the budget will be and who will manage it.
